A comparison between Neural Networks and Kalman Filters for time-series problems - final Project for EE381K - Estimation Theory.


This is the simulation code accompanying the survey paper. This simulation code compares the performance of LSTMs, RNNs, (implemented in Keras), EKFs, UKFs, and Kalman Filters in different tasks.
